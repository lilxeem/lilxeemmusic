                <p class="bio">What's up? I go by Lil Xeem. I'm a high school student and musician hailing from Southern California. I started my music journey in 2017, however I really began to take it more seriously around 2020. Below are some things that interest me!</p>

                            <p class="card-body">In 2022, I entered the world of Computer Science through a course at school. Within a few weeks, I was hooked on web design and development. I have experience using Jupyter Notebooks, VSCode, AWS, Backend Flask frameworks, and writing code in Javascript, Python, and HTML/CSS. I still consider myself a novice at web development, though I did create this site from scratch. I believe my biggest strength in Computer Science is frontend design, as I love graphic design in general and UI/UX interests me the most.</p>

                            <p class="card-body">The first song I ever remember hearing was Jumpman by Drake. One day in 2017, I googled how the beat was made, and I discovered producer Metro Boomin. From there, I started watching beatmaking tutorials on Youtube and began producing with a free website. After a couple months, I grew out of it and focused more on school. In late 2019, a good friend encouraged me to get back into making music, and I've been working consistently on it ever since. I began with basic hip-hop and dark rap beats, but later started to experiment with different genres like R&B, Lofi, Pop, and even Rock. Some of my biggest inspirations in music are Metro Boomin, Nick Mira, Kendrick Lamar, Travis Scott, Kanye, and Nav.</p>

                            <p class="card-body">I've had a love for cars for as long as I can remember. It runs in my family, as my grandfather was a mechanic and my father studied mechanical engineering. I don't really have a dream car, but I love the Mazda RX7, Honda NSX 1st Generation, and Nissan 350z. The car culture here in California is pretty big as well, so I like to go to car meets in my area. I've recently gotten into motorcycles and the biking community, and I love it just as much as cars.</p>
